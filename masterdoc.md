**FoodApp Test-Driven Development Strategy & Tech Architecture**

This single source of truth merges every requirement—from user stories to tech stack to testing conventions—so all team members stay aligned. All tooling versions are pinned to eliminate environment drift.

---

## 0. Project Setup (Initial)

- **Start by creating a new Next.js app:**
  ```sh
  npx create-next-app@latest foodapp --typescript --tailwind --eslint
  cd foodapp
  ```
- **Immediately install shadcn/ui:**
  ```sh
  npx shadcn@latest init
  ```
- This ensures all shadcn/ui CLI commands and component additions work smoothly from the start. Follow the [manual installation guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/manual) for any additional steps (dependencies, config, etc).

---

## 1. User Stories

1. **As a health-conscious user**, I want to track my daily macro- and micro-nutrient intake so I can meet my dietary goals.
2. **As a meal planner**, I want reusable meal models and a science-based planning engine that avoids ultra-processed foods and respects seasonality.
3. **As a home cook**, I want to manage my fridge inventory offline so I always know what I have.
4. **As a shopper**, I want to generate and export a categorized shopping list in CSV/JSON for easy grocery trips.
5. **As the app owner**, I want to store and retrieve profile preferences (dietary goals, allergy settings, notification intervals) securely in Supabase without requiring end-user authentication.
6. **As a user**, I want notification preferences and scheduled reminders for meal prep or shopping.
7. **As a mobile user**, I want PWA support with offline-first caching and sync-on-reconnect.
8. **As a tech-savvy user**, I want an OpenAI-powered meal planning assistant that returns structured meal suggestions based on my profile.
9. **As a developer**, I want to fetch detailed nutrition data from USDA's FoodData API to enrich meal information.
10. **As an end-user**, I want a consistent, mobile-first UI built with shadcn/ui components and responsive navigation.
11. **As a curious user**, I want science transparency modals explaining the rationale behind my meal plans.
12. **As a feedback-oriented user**, I want to rate meals and see a confetti animation on submit.
13. **As a stakeholder**, I want analytics events and logging, plus environment validation for safe production.
14. **As a QA engineer**, I want a full end-to-end flow test (plan → shop → feedback) with performance smoke tests.

## 2. Design & UX Principles

- **Shadcn/UI-first**: Build all UI exclusively with shadcn/ui components for consistency, theming, and accessibility. To install shadcn for nextjs run npx shadcn@latest init
- **Mobile-First & Responsive**: Start at 320px; scale up with Tailwind's responsive utilities.
- **Card-Based UI**: Use elevated `<Card>` components for meals, nutrition summaries, shopping items.
- **Spacing & Typography**: Consistent paddings (`p-4`, `m-4`), typographic scale (`text-base` → `text-xl`).
- **Modern Aesthetic**: 2xl rounded corners, soft shadows, subtle color palette in `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Bottom or top nav with lucide-react icons; active-state highlighting.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA contrast, semantic HTML, focus outlines, ARIA roles.
- **Dark Mode**: Honor system preference via Tailwind's `dark:` variants.
- **Quick Feedback**: Toasts (`<Toast>` from shadcn/ui) and confetti for positive reinforcement.
- **Design Tokens**: Centralized color, spacing, and shadow tokens for easy theming.

## 2a. FoodApp Design System

This design system outlines the FoodApp design system components, tokens, and usage guidelines - follow this whenever implementing UI or creating new components!!!

## Component Library Structure

The component library is organized in a tiered approach:

1. **UI Components (`/components/ui`)**: Basic, unstyled primitives like buttons, inputs, and form elements from shadcn/ui.

2. **Common Components (`/components/common`)**: Reusable components with application-specific styling like Card, FormField, and PageLayout.

3. **Feature Components (`/components/features/[feature]`)**: Domain-specific components for each feature area (meals, fridge, plan, etc.).

## Design Tokens (`/styles/tokens.ts`)

The design system is built on a set of tokens that define:

- Colors (primary, neutral, semantic)
- Spacing scale
- Typography (font sizes, weights, line heights)
- Border radius
- Shadows
- Animation durations
- Z-index scale

These tokens are imported into the Tailwind config to ensure consistency throughout the application.

## Common Components Usage

### Card

```tsx
import { Card } from '@/components/common/Card'

// Default card
<Card>Content</Card>

// Highlight card
<Card variant="highlight">Highlighted content</Card>

// Outlined card
<Card variant="outlined">Outlined content</Card>

// Compact card
<Card variant="compact">Compact content</Card>

// Clickable card
<Card onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>Clickable content</Card>
```

### FormField

```tsx
import { FormField } from "@/components/common/FormField";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";

<FormField
  id="name"
  label="Name"
  hint="Enter your full name"
  error={errors.name}
>
  <Input id="name" name="name" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
</FormField>;
```

### PageLayout

```tsx
import { PageLayout } from "@/components/common/PageLayout";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

<PageLayout
  title="Meals"
  subtitle="Manage your meals"
  actions={<Button>Add Meal</Button>}
>
  <div>Page content goes here</div>
</PageLayout>;
```

## Enhanced Button

The Button component has been enhanced with additional variants and features:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { PlusIcon } from 'lucide-react'

// Standard button
<Button>Click me</Button>

// Success button
<Button variant="success">Success</Button>

// Warning button
<Button variant="warning">Warning</Button>

// Soft button (lighter background)
<Button variant="soft">Soft</Button>

// With icon
<Button leftIcon={<PlusIcon className="w-4 h-4" />}>Add Item</Button>

// Loading state
<Button loading>Processing</Button>

// Full width
<Button fullWidth>Full width button</Button>
```

## Feature Components

Each feature area has specialized components that follow the design system guidelines:

### Meals

- MealCard: For displaying meal information

### Fridge

- IngredientCard: For displaying ingredient information

### Future Components

As the application grows, additional feature components will be added following the same design patterns.

## Tailwind CSS Usage

When creating new components:

1. Use the token-based classes from our system
2. Use the `cn()` utility for conditional class merging
3. Follow the responsive patterns (mobile-first)
4. Ensure accessibility with proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes

## Consistency Guidelines

- Use predefined spacing values (`p-4`, `m-6`, etc.)
- Follow the color system (primary, neutral, semantic colors)
- Use consistent border radius values (prefer rounded-2xl for cards)
- Maintain typography hierarchy (headings, body text, captions)

---

## 3. Architecture & Data Flow

- **App Router**: Next.js 13.4+ App Directory (`src/app`). Define `layout.tsx` for global UI and `page.tsx` for each route.
- **Server vs. Client Components**:
  - Default components are Server Components (run on server, can fetch data directly).
  - Add `'use client'` at the top for Client Components (interactive UI, state/hooks).
- **Data Fetching**:
  - **Server Components**: Use native `fetch`, Supabase JS in server mode, or Prisma calls.
  - **Mutations**: Prefer Next.js **Server Actions** for form submits; if not possible, use `/src/app/api/.../route.ts` API route handlers.
- **Database/API**:
  - Single-user context; no end-user auth.
  - Initialize Supabase client with service role key (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) in Server Components or Server Actions only.
  - Never expose Supabase keys to client-side code.
- **State Management Boundaries**:
  - **Server Components** handle data fetching & business logic.
  - **Client Components** manage local UI state (modals, toggles, form inputs).
  - **Data Caching**: Use SWR (v2.2.5) or React Query (v5.2.0) in Client Components for remote data & mutations.
  - **Global State**: Avoid global stores; if necessary, use Context or Zustand (v4.5.1) only for cross-component UI state.
- **Runtime**:
  - Default Node.js runtime for API routes; consider Edge runtime (Vercel) for low-latency critical endpoints.

### 3d. Schema Migration & Mock Data Workflow (Manual via Supabase SQL UI)

**Schema Reference & Workflow Update (2024-06):**

- The master schema will be maintained under `prisma/schema.prisma` as a reference for all tables, relations, and types.
- **However, all actual schema changes and migrations will be performed manually in the Supabase UI** (SQL Editor), following the workflow below.
- The Prisma schema is the canonical reference for structure and documentation, but is not used for automated migrations or client generation.
- Manual SQL files in `migrations/` and mock data in `mockdata/` should match the reference schema.
- **Do not use `prisma db push` or `prisma migrate`—all migrations are manual via SQL.**

This section outlines the process for making, verifying, and documenting schema changes using Supabase's SQL UI, along with optional mock data setup for development and testing.

**1. Write and Version Your Migration**

- Create a new `.sql` file in the `migrations/` folder.
- Use a descriptive filename with a timestamp, e.g.:

  ```
  migrations/2025-05-23-add-meal-tags.sql
  ```

- Include `-- up` and `-- down` comments if reversibility is desired.
- Example:

  ```sql
  -- up
  CREATE TABLE meal_tags (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
  );

  ALTER TABLE meal ADD COLUMN tag_ids UUID[];

  -- down
  ALTER TABLE meal DROP COLUMN tag_ids;
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS meal_tags;
  ```

**2. (Optional) Add Mock Data for Testing**

- Add a corresponding `.sql` file in a `mockdata/` folder:

  ```
  mockdata/meal_tags.testdata.sql
  ```

- Populate minimal sample rows for local development or E2E test runs.
- Example:

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO meal_tags (name) VALUES ('High Protein'), ('Low Carb'), ('Vegan');
  ```

**3. Manual Application via Supabase SQL UI**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor.
2. Paste and run the contents of your migration SQL file.
3. Optionally, run your mock data insert file.
4. **Pause development here and verify manually:**
   - Query tables and columns.
   - Use Supabase Table Editor to inspect schema changes.
   - Test your local app build against the updated schema.

**4. Commit and Document the Change**

- Commit both SQL files to version control:

  ```sh
  git add migrations/2025-05-23-add-meal-tags.sql mockdata/meal_tags.testdata.sql
  git commit -m "SPRINT-4:db(meals): add meal_tags table and mock data"
  ```

- Update the Decision Log (§8):
  - Date
  - Title of schema change
  - Rationale and consequences
- Update relevant sections:
  - §3a Core Data Models — reflect any new or modified tables
  - §6 Sprint Plan — note if the migration was part of a sprint deliverable

---

### 3e. CRUD Operation Standards

To maintain consistency in our codebase and prevent implementation drift, follow these guidelines for all CRUD operations:

#### 1. Route Parameter Handling (Next.js 15+)

```typescript
// Always use Promise-based params
export async function GET(
  request: Request,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
) {
  // Always await params before accessing properties
  const { id } = await params;

  // Continue with database operations
}
```

#### 2. Database Table Naming Conventions

- Use singular form for all table names (e.g., `meal_ingredient` not `meal_ingredients`)
- Foreign key columns should end with `_id` (e.g., `meal_id`, `ingredient_id`)
- Join table names should combine the two entities in singular form (e.g., `meal_ingredient`)
- Primary keys should be named `id` and use UUIDs

#### 3. API Route Structure

- Basic resource routes: `/api/[resource]/route.ts`
- Single item routes: `/api/[resource]/[id]/route.ts`
- Nested resources: `/api/[resource]/[id]/[subresource]/[subid]/route.ts`
- Implement HTTP methods according to REST conventions:
  - `GET` (collection): List all resources
  - `GET` (item): Get single resource by ID
  - `POST`: Create new resource
  - `PUT`: Update existing resource (full or partial)
  - `DELETE`: Remove resource

#### 4. API Query Structure (Supabase)

```typescript
// Standard query pattern with relations
const { data, error } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from("table_name")
  .select(
    `
    *,
    related_table!foreign_key (
      *,
      nested_related_table:foreign_key (id, name)
    )
  `
  )
  .eq("id", id)
  .single();

// Standard error handling
if (error) {
  console.error(`Error fetching resource ${id}:`, error);
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: "Failed to fetch resource" },
    { status: error.code === "PGRST116" ? 404 : 500 }
  );
}
```

#### 5. Client-Side Service Pattern

Define service objects in `api-services.ts` with consistent method naming:

```typescript
export const resourceService = {
  async getAll(): Promise<Resource[]> {
    /* ... */
  },
  async get(id: string): Promise<Resource> {
    /* ... */
  },
  async create(data: CreateResourceDto): Promise<Resource> {
    /* ... */
  },
  async update(id: string, data: UpdateResourceDto): Promise<Resource> {
    /* ... */
  },
  async delete(id: string): Promise<{ success: boolean }> {
    /* ... */
  },
};
```

#### 6. Component Structure

- **Server Components (`page.tsx`):**
  - Fetch data directly using Supabase
  - Handle awaiting Promises (including params)
  - Pass data to client components via props
  - Use `notFound()` for 404 handling

```typescript
export default async function ResourcePage({ params }: ResourcePageProps) {
  const { id } = await params;
  // Fetch data and handle errors
  return <ResourceForm resource={data} isEditing={true} />;
}
```

- **Client Components:**
  - Add `"use client";` directive
  - Handle form state with react-hook-form + zod
  - Use service objects for API calls
  - Manage loading/error states

#### 7. Form Components for CRUD

```typescript
"use client";

import { z } from "zod";
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";

// Define zod schema
const formSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, "Name is required"),
  // Additional fields
});

export function ResourceForm({ resource, isEditing }: ResourceFormProps) {
  // Initialize form with react-hook-form + zod
  const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof formSchema>>({
    resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
    defaultValues: resource || {},
  });

  // Form submission logic
  const onSubmit = async (values: z.infer<typeof formSchema>) => {
    // API calls via service object
  };

  // Form UI with shadcn/ui components
}
```

These standards ensure our CRUD implementations remain consistent, maintainable, and compatible with Next.js 15+ while following best practices for type safety and error handling.
