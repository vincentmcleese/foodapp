# Sprint 18 Completion: "I Want Something Specific" Feature

## Overview

In Sprint 18, we implemented a new feature that allows users to request specific meal recommendations based on their own criteria. This enhancement improves the user experience by providing more personalized meal suggestions and gives users greater control over the discovery process.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Specific Request Modal

- Created a new `SpecificRequestModal` component with a text input area for users to describe exactly what they're looking for
- Implemented a clean and intuitive interface with helpful placeholder examples
- Added proper loading states and error handling
- Ensured the modal is fully accessible and responsive

### 2. "I Want Something Specific" Button

- Added a prominent button to the Discover page using the Sparkles icon
- Integrated the button with the modal for a seamless user experience
- Positioned the button in the page header for maximum visibility
- Implemented the same button in the MealRecommendationList component for consistency

### 3. API Enhancements

- Updated the `RecommendationRequest` interface to include the `specificRequest` parameter
- Enhanced the `/api/meals/recommendations` endpoint to accept and process specific requests
- Modified the `generateMealRecommendations` function to incorporate user-specific requests into the OpenAI prompts
- Implemented intelligent model selection (GPT-4o for specific requests, GPT-3.5-turbo for general recommendations) to balance quality and performance

### 4. UI/UX Improvements

- Added dedicated loading states for specific requests
- Customized the page subtitle to display the user's specific request
- Ensured proper error handling and user feedback
- Maintained consistency with the existing design system

### 5. Technical Improvements

- Used the more capable GPT-4o model for specific requests to provide higher quality, more contextual responses
- Optimized the API call to balance performance and quality
- Ensured proper URL encoding of query parameters

## Testing

The implementation was tested for:

- Proper handling of user input in the modal
- Correct transmission of specific requests to the API
- Appropriate loading states and error handling
- Responsive design across different screen sizes
- Edge cases with empty or very long specific requests

## User Benefits

This feature provides several key benefits to users:

1. Greater control over meal recommendations
2. More relevant meal suggestions based on specific criteria
3. Ability to explore different cuisines, ingredients, or dietary preferences
4. Improved user engagement through a more interactive experience
5. Faster access to meals that match exact requirements

## Future Improvements

For future sprints, we could consider:

- Saving previous specific requests for quick reuse
- Adding common specific request templates (like "Quick meals," "Kid-friendly," etc.)
- Implementing natural language processing to better understand and categorize user requests
- Adding a history of past specific requests
- Allowing users to share their specific request results with others

## Conclusion

Sprint 18 successfully delivered the "I Want Something Specific" feature, which enhances the meal discovery experience by allowing users to specify exactly what kind of meals they're looking for. This feature builds on the improvements made in Sprint 17 and provides a more personalized, user-driven approach to meal recommendations.
