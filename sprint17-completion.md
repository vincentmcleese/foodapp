# Sprint 17 Completion: Standardize Meal Cards in "Discover Meals"

## Overview

In Sprint 17, we focused on improving the UI consistency and performance of the "Discover Meals" feature. The key objectives were:

1. Update meal cards in the discover page to match the style of meal cards on the /meals page
2. Remove unnecessary cuisine, time, and preparation filters
3. Add a placeholder message indicating "Save to create image" instead of generating images
4. Optimize OpenAI API calls to reduce response time

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Standardized Meal Card Design

- Updated `MealRecommendationCard.tsx` to use the same `Card` component and styling as the regular meal cards
- Aligned layout, typography, and spacing to match the existing meal card design
- Used the same nutrition information display format for consistency
- Added "Save to create image" placeholder message to improve UX

### 2. Removed Unnecessary Filters

- Removed cuisine filter from the discover page
- Removed preparation time filter and slider
- Streamlined the UI to focus on the meal recommendations
- Changed the grid layout to display 4 cards per row on desktop (matching the meals page)

### 3. Improved Placeholder for Images

- Added a clear "Save to create image" message overlay on image placeholders
- Updated the MealImage component to properly handle the pending state
- Ensured consistent image sizing and placeholder display

### 4. Optimized OpenAI API Performance

- Reduced token usage by simplifying prompts:
  - Limited fridge items to top 15 most relevant
  - Shortened health principles format to use comma-separated list
  - Limited meal ratings to top 5 with simplified format
  - Streamlined system prompt and user instructions
- Switched from GPT-4o to GPT-3.5-turbo for initial recommendations to improve response time
- Set a max_tokens limit to prevent unnecessarily large responses
- Reduced default recommendation count from 6 to 3 for faster initial page load

### 5. Improved Page Layout

- Standardized the use of PageLayout component across all views
- Made the loading state match the actual content layout
- Improved error handling and error state display

## Testing

The changes were tested for:

- Visual consistency between meal cards on both pages
- Proper responsiveness on various screen sizes
- Improved load time of the discover page
- Correct display of meal information and placeholders
- Proper error handling and loading states

## Future Improvements

For future sprints, we might consider:

- Adding the "I want something specific" button as mentioned in Sprint 18 planning
- Further improving API response time with caching strategies
- Implementing pagination instead of "Load More" for better performance
- Adding skeleton loading animations for a smoother UX

## Conclusion

Sprint 17 successfully improves the "Discover Meals" feature by standardizing the UI, removing unnecessary filters, and optimizing API calls for better performance. The updated implementation provides a more consistent user experience while reducing load times.
