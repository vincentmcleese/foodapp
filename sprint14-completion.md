# Sprint 14 Completion Report: Fridge Percentage Badges & Enhanced Meal Selection

## Overview

Sprint 14 has successfully implemented two key features to enhance the user experience: fridge percentage badges on meal cards and an improved meal selection modal for the planning page.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Fridge Percentage Badges

- Added "% in fridge" badges to meal cards showing what percentage of ingredients are available in the user's fridge inventory
- Implemented color-coded badges for quick visual assessment:
  - Green: 100% of ingredients available
  - Blue: 50-99% of ingredients available
  - Gray: Less than 50% of ingredients available
- Displayed on both the plan page and meals page for consistent user experience

### 2. Enhanced Meal Selection UI

- Created a new MealSelectorModal component that replaces the simple dropdown in the plan entry form
- Implemented a grid layout of meal cards, similar to the meals page
- Added search functionality to filter meals by name or description
- Included fridge percentage badges in the modal for better meal planning decisions
- Added responsive design for different screen sizes
- Implemented loading states with skeleton UI for improved user experience

### 3. Technical Improvements

- Created a reusable `calculateFridgePercentage` utility function in the meal library
- Fixed an "Invalid time value" error in PlanCalendar by properly initializing weekDates
- Ensured meal ratings are fetched and displayed correctly after page refresh
- Enhanced the MealCard component to accept and display fridge percentage information

## Technical Implementation

### Utility Functions

The core functionality revolves around the `calculateFridgePercentage` function:

```typescript
export function calculateFridgePercentage(
  mealIngredients: MealIngredient[],
  fridgeItems: FridgeItem[]
): number {
  if (!mealIngredients?.length) return 0;

  // Create a map of fridge items by ingredient ID
  const fridgeMap = new Map(
    fridgeItems.map((item) => [item.ingredient_id, item])
  );

  // Count ingredients available in fridge
  const availableCount = mealIngredients.filter((mi) => {
    const fridgeItem = fridgeMap.get(mi.ingredient_id);

    // For pantry items, check if in stock
    if (mi.ingredient?.ingredient_type === "pantry") {
      return fridgeItem?.status === "IN_STOCK";
    }

    // For regular ingredients, check if available and has sufficient quantity
    return fridgeItem && (fridgeItem.quantity || 0) >= mi.quantity;
  }).length;

  return Math.round((availableCount / mealIngredients.length) * 100);
}
```

### Component Architecture

1. **MealCard Enhancement**:

   - Updated to accept and display fridgePercentage prop
   - Added color-coded Badge component based on percentage

2. **MealCardWithFridgePercentage**:

   - Wrapper component that handles fridge data fetching
   - Calculates percentage and passes to MealCard

3. **MealSelectorModal**:
   - Dialog-based modal with grid layout
   - Search functionality for filtering meals
   - Displays meal cards with fridge percentages

## Code Quality Assessment

The implementation follows best practices:

- **Component Composition**: Leveraged the existing MealCard component and enhanced it rather than creating duplicate code
- **Single Responsibility**: Separated data fetching (in wrapper components) from presentation (in UI components)
- **Reusable Utility Functions**: Created a single source of truth for percentage calculations
- **Consistent UI Elements**: Used shadcn/ui Badge component with consistent color coding
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented proper grid layouts for different screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Added skeleton UI for improved user experience

Overall code quality score: 8/10

## Conclusion

Sprint 14 successfully delivered both required features while maintaining code quality and user experience. The implementation enhances the meal planning workflow by providing users with immediate visual feedback about ingredient availability and a more intuitive meal selection experience.
