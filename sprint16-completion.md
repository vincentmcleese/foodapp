# Sprint 16 Completion Report

## Overview

Sprint 16 focused on implementing week navigation in the meal planning calendar and streamlining the meal planning user experience.

## Completed Features

### Week Navigation

- Added week navigation controls to allow cycling through past and future weeks
- Implemented "Previous Week" and "Next Week" buttons for intuitive navigation
- Added a "Current Week" button for quick return to the current week
- Implemented date range display showing the viewed week's range (e.g., "Jun 3 - Jun 9, 2024")
- Fixed meal filtering to show meals for the specific viewed week

### UX Improvements

- Removed redundant "Add to Plan" button and description card for a cleaner UI
- Eliminated separate page for editing plan entries, handling all actions directly in the calendar
- Streamlined meal planning workflow by using modals for both adding and editing meals
- Added toast notifications for better user feedback
- Made mobile navigation more compact with responsive design

## Technical Improvements

- Removed redundant PlanEntryForm component and related pages
- Refactored date handling to support week navigation with proper filtering
- Used existing UI components for consistency
- Consolidated meal selection logic into a single approach
- Reduced navigation between pages by handling all actions in-place

## User Flow Changes

- **Before**: Adding a meal required navigating to a form page, selecting date/meal type, then selecting a meal
- **After**: Users can click directly on calendar slots and select a meal from a modal
- **Before**: Editing a meal required navigating to a dedicated edit page
- **After**: Editing is handled directly in the calendar view with the same meal selector modal

## Code Quality

- Maintained responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- Added proper error handling with visual feedback
- Used TypeScript throughout for type safety
- Followed project coding standards and naming conventions
