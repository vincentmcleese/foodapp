# Sprint 15 Completion Report: Health Principles Integration

## Overview

Sprint 15 has successfully implemented the integration of health principles with meals, allowing users to filter meals based on dietary needs and preferences. The implementation includes database changes, API enhancements, and UI updates to support this feature.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Database and Data Model Updates

- Created a new `meal_health_principle` join table to establish a many-to-many relationship between meals and health principles
- Added proper indexing and referential integrity constraints
- Documented the schema changes with a migration file

### 2. API Enhancements

- Updated the `/api/meals/save` endpoint to accept and store health principles with meals
- Enhanced the `/api/meals` endpoint to support filtering by health principles
- Added support for sorting meals by fridge percentage, allowing users to prioritize meals they already have ingredients for

### 3. UI Improvements

- Created a new `MealFilter` component with health principle checkboxes and fridge percentage sorting
- Integrated the filter component into both the main Meals page and the Meal Selector modal
- Updated the meal recommendation system to save selected health principles with meals

### 4. Code Reuse and Optimization

- Leveraged existing code patterns and components
- Created a reusable `applyMealFilters` utility function
- Maintained consistent UI elements like the shadcn/ui Checkbox component
- Used the same filter component across different pages for consistency

## Technical Implementation

The implementation follows a clean architecture approach with:

1. **Data Layer**: Updated database schema and API endpoints
2. **Service Layer**: Enhanced API services to handle the new data requirements
3. **UI Layer**: Created consistent filtering UI components

## Future Considerations

- Expand health principles filtering to the recommendations feature
- Add health principle badges to meal cards for quick visual identification
- Create analytics to track the most common health principles used

## Conclusion

Sprint 15 has successfully implemented the health principles integration feature, enhancing the app's ability to provide personalized meal options based on dietary preferences and restrictions.
